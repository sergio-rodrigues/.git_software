# Software Installation Script
This project provides a Bash script for managing the installation and removal of software packages defined in a list. 
It supports installing new software, pruning (deleting) installed software, and displaying help instructions.

## Overview
The script operates by reading a list of software from a file, where each line specifies a software package's name, download URL, and installation path. 
It supports adding aliases for easy access to the installed software and handles both direct downloads and extraction from compressed files.
