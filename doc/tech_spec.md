# Technical Specification

## Overview

The script is written in Bash and designed to run on Unix-like operating systems. It reads a list of software specifications from a file and performs actions based on the command-line arguments provided.

## Key Components

- **Environment Variables**: Uses `SOFTWARE_PATH`, `SOFTWARE_LIST_FILE`, and `ALIAS_FILE` for configuration.
- **Software List File**: A file where each line specifies a software package's name, download URL, and installation path, separated by `|`.
- **Alias Management**: Checks for existing aliases and updates them as needed during installation.

## Operations

- **Installation**: Downloads software from the specified URL, handles extraction if necessary, and adds an alias.
- **Pruning**: Removes installed software directories and their corresponding aliases.
- **Help Instructions**: Provides usage information and available commands.

## Dependencies

- `curl`: For downloading software.
- `unzip`: For extracting `.zip` files.

## Error Handling

- Exits if required environment variables are not set.
- Skips installation or removal if conditions are not met (e.g., software already installed).

## Execution Modes

- Can be run directly with command-line arguments (`--install`, `--prune`).
- Defaults to installation mode if no arguments are provided.
- Defaults to help mode if an unknown arguments is provided.
- Supports being sourced from another script for direct function calls.
